- Drawing transport is a project utilizing javascript in which multiple computers can connect to a virtual canvas and simultaneously work on a single artwork piece. The color of the pen changes depending on location of the screen and speed of brush movement.
- Bot utilizes a twitch-bot that connects to twitch chats and responds to various commands. The bot is also connected to an arduino nano device that is connected to a hadn cutout. The hand waves back and forth whenever "hello world" is typed in the chat the bot is connected to. This is one of my first projects attempting to influence hardware with virtual commands in realtime.
